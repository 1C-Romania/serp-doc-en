Registering air conditioner release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user selects a demand satisfaction source under the customer order.
The following sources are available in the application: production order
in the warehouse or in a company department, purchase order, warehouse
stock. In this case, divide the order into two parts as it is fulfilled
by different departments (one is responsible for assembly, and the other
is responsible for mounting).

You can generate the **Production order** document on the basis of the
**Customer order** document with the **Sales order** operation kind. The
new document is addressed to the **Assembly shop** department.
